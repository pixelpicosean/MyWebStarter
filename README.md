# ES6 & SASS Boilerplate

> A boilerplate for developing webapps with ES6 & SASS.

## Usage

1. Install Gulp globally: `npm install -g gulp`
2. Run `npm install` and then `jspm install` in the root directory
3. Run `gulp` or `npm start` to start the local dev server

### Note

Make sure that the `src/css` and `src/img` folder exist, they
are ignored by Git but required for building tasks.

## Generating documentation

Run `npm run docs` to generate documentation for your JavaScript and SASS automatically in the `docs` folder.

## Building

Run `gulp build` or `npm run build` to build the app for distribution in the `dist` folder.
